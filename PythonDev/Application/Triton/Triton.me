TRITON is a Greek god of the sea, the son of Poseidon and Amphitrite, god and goddess of the sea respectively.
This is the name for our Python-variation of the Thetis Application, as I thought it would be fitting to have a greek god,
instead of a sea nymph be the name for this application, as he will control the robot.
